# `DUMB_1.0p` Idiot Connector

the best muzzle device in the hobby

## What is this?

Requires two Dash-014 O-rings to be assembled. Prints without supports. May not be oriented properly.

This is a print that will allow you to connect two blasters barrel to barrel. You can have EPIC PLUNGER SEAL BATTLES OF HISTORY by firing both blasters at the same time.

There's also `EXTRA_DarticleAccelerator`, an alternate `Core` print that has a viewing window so you can shoot a dart out of each blaster and smash them together in the middle. 

## Why did you make this? 

I thought it would be really funny, so I made this.

## ATTRIBUTION

The collet system was lightly modified from Sillybutts' SCAR/PCAR collection to fit the existing Charamile Designs aesthetic. 

## COMMERCIAL

Contact me for sales. I have no idea why you'd want to sell this.
