# `DUMB_1.0p` Idiot Connector

relativistic levels of stupid

## What is this?

Requires two Dash-016 O-rings to be assembled. Prints without supports. May not be oriented properly.

This is a print that will allow you to connect two blasters barrel to barrel. You can have EPIC PLUNGER SEAL BATTLES OF HISTORY by firing both blasters at the same time.

There's also `EXTRA_DarticleAccelerator`, an alternate `Core` print that has a viewing window so you can shoot a dart out of each blaster and smash them together in the middle for relativistic levels of stupid and fun.

## Why did you make this? 

I thought it would be really funny, so I made this.
